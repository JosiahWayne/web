    <p>This is Josiah's Website fo CSCI-UA 4!</p>
    <p>I’m Yanhao (Josiah) Li, a Computer Science undergraduate at NYU Shanghai currently studying away in New York. My academic interests sit at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision, especially generative models and representation learning. In this course, I’m hoping to strengthen my ability to communicate ideas clearly through writing and discussion, and to connect close reading with broader historical and social contexts. </p>
